###Quoting code

Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```
